# FOUNDATIONS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

##### This is part of code from my research experience under the construction of Prof.Chu. This work is to investigate trading strategies to study the market efficiency and assess the maturity of the cryptocurrency market. We focus on return-based trading strategies such as technical analysis based on 10 price patterns as in Lo et al. (2000), which have been used since the 16th century but have only become popular with academics in the past 50 years. These cover all types of market conditions and are commonly used in finance, by academics, and are more complex than simple trading rules. Moreover, due to the lack of a fundamental value for cryptocurrencies, traditional valuation models (such as the discounting cash flow) do not apply, and many traders rely on technical analysis as to analyze cryptocurrency prices.The framework for our work can be divided into three main sections: i) information inferred from trading strategies; ii) performance of trading strategies based on the predictability of prices; iii) profitability of trading strategies.

##### 1.descriptive statistics.ipynb show the code which would show descriptive statistics on tokens.
##### 2.Kernel regression.ipynb show the code which would preform kernel regression on the series. 
##### 3.Find Min&Max .ipynb would add label on the Max&Min for the next step.
##### 4.pattern count.ipynb is the code which present how the tech analysis, while Pattern count.ipynb is the actual code I do the analysis.
##### 5.defi_data.csv is the data from Yahoo finance 
##### 6.semi.ipynb is using geometric brownian motion model to make N simulated price series
