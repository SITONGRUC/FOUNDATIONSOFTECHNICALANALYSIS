# FOUNDATIONSOFTECHNICALANALYSIS
This is part of code from my research experience under the construction of Prof.Chu. It is mainly the copy of one paper from Andrew W. Lo, mainlu Foundations of technical analysis: Computational algorithms, statistical inference, and empirical implementation.
The code was presented into two part. First we presented kernel regression on price series and second we would check ten pattern which was shown in the 
paper above.
