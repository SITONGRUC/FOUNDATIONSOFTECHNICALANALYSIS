# FOUNDATIONS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
This is part of code from my research experience under the construction of Prof.Chu. It is mainly the copy of one paper from Andrew W. Lo, mainlu Foundations of technical analysis: Computational algorithms, statistical inference, and empirical implementation, but focus on defi data. 
######1.descriptive statistics.ipynb show the code which would show descriptive statistics on tokens.
######2.Kernel regression.ipynb show the code which would preform kernel regression on the series. 
######3.Find Min&Max .ipynb would add label on the Max&Min for the next step.
######4.pattern count.ipynb is the code which present how the tech analysis, while Pattern count.ipynb is the actual code I do the analysis.
The code was presented into two part. First we presented kernel regression on price series and second we would check ten pattern which was shown in the 
paper above.
